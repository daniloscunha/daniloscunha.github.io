## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Css Functions

### What I learned

Use flex-direction to change the order of the flex-itens;
Use clamp function to change the font-size responsively.

### Continued development

I need more practice to better understand how to create responsive heights in flex-itens. The calc function was used in this challenge.
